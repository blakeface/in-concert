### NOTE: This was a test branch to use react-native. It was decided that I'm trying something more ingrained wiht the Meteor environment and didn't want to separate my frontend. ###

### ðŸ›  Specs:
  * Meteor
  * React Native    

### ðŸ“² To install / run / build:
  * install [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) & [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.33/docs/getting-started.html)    

  * setup meteor server and fire her up!  
  `$ cd meteor`   
  `$ npm install`  
  `$ npm start` (alternatively `$ meteor`)      

  * setup react-native app and fire her up!:  
  `$ cd ../reactnative`   
  `$ npm install`  
  `$ react-native run-ios` OR `$ react-native run-android` (whichever tickles your fancy)
